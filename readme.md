# Welcome on my markdown style blog :smile:

Recently i decided to gather in the same place usefull informations i fallen on during my learning process. Usually it was my bookemarks but it's not the best place for at least two main reasons :
* it's not user friendly
* how can i share them keeping the hierarchy i've made

So i decided to use [github](https://github.com/) combined to [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) in order to share to the world ressources which are useful hoping they will be useful for others. I started [here](https://github.com/PhDStudentsP13/ScalaAndSparkUsefullLinks) with my every day technology [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) and [Spark](http://spark.apache.org/). Some Ph.D students friends joined me and we hope to build a nice resume of links but also explanation of our favorite technology and computer science subjects. It was originately open to Paris 13 University Ph.D students but any motivated person can join us.

For the moments it's mainly links resuming in few words and organized roughly but it will be filled with explanations as soon as possible.
